We will cluster admissions based on clinical data, and we will compare the clinical data of the clusters.

Based on lab results (values, not presence) from the Ô¨Årst hour of ICU admission, as well as demographic data including gender, age, admission type, admission location, insurance, marital status, ethnicity we create clusters to compare the clinical data.

We limit number labs to 40.
